// TODO: Design a more elegant solution for balances hydration.
// What follows is a solution that works, but is a bit of a workaround.
//
// Scenario:
//   - We don't want to send a copy of every chain along with every balance a la:
//     { id: 'balanceid', chain: { ...allChainFields }, free: '10', reserved: '10' }
//   - The balance object needs to know about its chain in order to be formatted as anything other than planck.
//   - We retrieve balances and chains separately from the backend and then 'hydrate' the balances with the chains.
//   - We expect methods like `balance.total.tokens` to work without needing to wait on some data (the chains) to load.
//
// Current design:
//   - Fetch all chains early on and store them in a cache.
//   - Hydrate incoming balances with chaindata from the cache. Don't put them anywhere useful until after hydration is complete.
//   - Add hydrated balances to the BehaviorSubject which is passed to whoever calls useBalances.
//
// Pros:
//   - Relatively simple.
//   - Quick and easy to implement.
//   - Only hydrated balances are shown in the UI == less loading cases to deal with when building the UI components.
//
// Cons:
//   - Requires caching all chains inside the balances hook.
//   - Balances are completely unavailable until chains cache is built. Even for code which doesn't rely on chaindata (e.g. how many chains does the user have non-zero balances on).
//   - Requires implementing the (Balances + BalancesUpdate => Balances) logic inside this hook instead of inside `@core/util/balances.ts` where it probably belongs.
//   - If some chaindata is updated (let's say the tokenDecimals for polkadot changes from 18 to 10), existing balances shown in the UI won't be updated to show this.
//
// Ideas for a future design:
//   - Maybe instead of hydrating the balances with their chains, we provide them non-async access to the chaindata already available on the frontend.
//   - When either a balance updates OR a chain updates or more data becomes available, all users of the non-async data which is available are told to re-render.
//   - This would allow sync access to e.g. the `balance.total.tokens` method once the data is available, but also allow this method to return null when the data
//     is not yet available. Once the data is available react can be responsible for updating the UI which is using the method.
//   - UI or other hooks which require this data to be available could return early if `balance.total.tokens === null` and wait for a future re-render before proceeding.
